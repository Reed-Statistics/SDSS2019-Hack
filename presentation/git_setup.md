# Configuring GitHub and Git

Presentations from the hackathon will be stored in the [SDSS2019-Hack](https://github.com/Reed-Statistics/SDSS2019-Hack) GitHub repo. You will need to install *git* / *GitBash*, have an ssh key and a GitHub account. The following section will help you do that.
1. You will *git* installed. In Windows it referred to as **GitBash**. For instructions on doing installing it in Windows, we have created a [guide](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2019/blob/master/setup/git%20for%20Windows/git%20for%20Windows.pdf) or you can use this [tutorial](https://www.onlinetutorialspoint.com/git/how-to-install-git-windows-10-operating-system.html). On Windows 10 you can also install it in the Ubuntu console. For the Mac, [download the installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/).
1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join), if you do not have one.
1. You will need a *ssh key*. Follow these [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to create one. Make sure you choose your OS at the top.
1. Your *ssh key* needs to be registered in your GitHub account. Follow these [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) to add your public *ssh key* to your GitHub account. Make sure you choose your OS at the top. 
1. Clone the hackathon repo. Go to a command line terminal (Linux/Mac) or *GitBash* in Windows. There are two ways to do this, do **not** use the *https://github.com/Reed-Statistics/SDSS2019-Hack* URL. Instead, use the following command:
```
git clone git@github.com:Reed-Statistics/SDSS2019-Hack.git
```
